This region is comprised of six divisions: Fako, Koupé-Manengouba, Lebialem, Manyu, Meme, and Ndian. Bernard Okalia B. serves as the Governor, while Zacheus Bakoma presides over the Regional Assembly and Executive Council. Covering a total area of 25,410 square kilometers, the Southwest Region had a population of 1,553,320 in 2015, resulting in a population density of 61.13 people per square kilometer. In 2022, the region recorded a Human Development Index of 0.676, categorizing it as medium and ranking it second out of ten regions in Cameroon.
The Southwest Region or South-West Region (French: Région du Sud-Ouest) is a region with special status in Cameroon. Its capital is Buea.[3] As of 2015[update], its population was 1,553,320. Along with the Northwest Region, it is one of the two Anglophone (English-speaking) regions of Cameroon. Various Ambazonian nationalist and separatist factions regard the South-West region as being distinct as a polity from Cameroon.[4]




History[edit]
In 1884, the region was colonized by Germany under the Protectorate regime until 1916 when it became a condominium administered jointly by the United Kingdom and France.[5] In 1919, the administration of the South West region became solely British.
In 1961, the region joined Cameroon as part of the federated state of West Cameroon.[6]
At the end of 2017, an Ambazonian separatist movement in the two English-speaking regions of the North-West and South-West initiated a wave of violence affecting the military, police, business leaders and workers. The separatist militiamen are trying in particular to prevent children from returning to school. Between 2016 and 2019, separatists reportedly ransacked, destroyed or burned more than 174 schools[7] Separatists from the Ambazonia administration regard both the Northwest and Southwest regions as being constituent components of their envisaged breakaway state.[8]

Administration[edit]

The region is divided into six divisions or departments: Fako, Koupé-Manengouba, Lebialem, Manyu, Meme and Ndian. These are in turn broken down into subdivisions.[9] Presidentially appointed senior divisional officers (prefets) and subdivisional officers (sous-prefets) govern each respectively.

Special status[edit]
As part of the Major National Dialogue, the region was given a "special status" in December 2019, granting additional rights and responsibilities in relation to economic, health, social, educational, sports and cultural development.[10][11] Under the special status the region has a bicameral Regional Assembly, made up of a 20-member House of Chiefs composed of traditional leaders and a 70-member House of Divisional Representatives nominated by municipal councils. The Regional Assembly appoints a Regional Executive Council.[12] Additional powers over health and education were also granted to municipalities.[13]

Regional Executive Council[edit]
The Regional Executive Council is led by the President of the Regional Assembly and includes a vice president, three commissioners, two secretaries and a questor.[12] The first committee, elected in December 2020, was as follows:[14]

Bakoma Elango Zacheus holds the prominent positions of President of the Regional Assembly, President of the House of Divisional Representatives, and President of the Regional Executive Council. Atem Ebako serves as Vice-President of the Regional Assembly, President of the House Chiefs, and Vice-President of the Regional Executive Council. The table also lists several commissioners: Mokoko Simon Gobina is the Commissioner for Economic Development, Itoe Williams Elangwe oversees Security and Social Development, and Taking Walters Ayuk is responsible for Education, Sports, and Cultural Development. Finally, Limunga Becky Effoe and Chief Foto Felix both serve as Secretary, while Tazie Andrew holds the role of Questor.
Geography[edit]
The region was notable for having the first English-speaking university in Cameroon (the University of Buea).
Towns include the capital Buea, Limbe, Tiko, Kumba and Mamfe. Limbe in particular is a popular tourist resort notable for its fine beaches. Korup National Park is also a major attraction. Buea itself, meanwhile, sits at the foot of Mount Cameroon, and possesses an almost temperate climate markedly different from the rest of the province.

The collection of images showcases various aspects of Limbe and Buea, Cameroon. Limbe's coastal charm is evident through depictions of thatched roof structures and general views of Bota Beach, Semme Beach, and Bioko Beach, alongside a tourist enjoying Limbe Beach and fishing canoes at Down Beach, all contributing to the image of Limbe Beach with its beautiful sandy shore. Inland, Korup Park features a waterfall, while Buea is represented by its university, with images of the parking space and the administration building, as well as a view of Mount Cameroon from Sopo and a broader perspective of Buea City. The Reunification Monument in Buea is also highlighted with both extensive and closer views.
Culture[edit]
The province is largely Anglophone and Protestant Christian.[15]

A collection of images showcases various folk dances, with a prominent display of groups performing in what appears to be a southwestern style. The visual content includes multiple depictions of dancers, suggesting a vibrant cultural tradition.
Common dishes in the region[edit]
A diverse array of Cameroonian dishes is presented, including the traditional pairing of eru with water fufu, a flavorful fish barbecue served with fried potatoes, and a chicken barbecue from "48 spices" in Buea. Other culinary highlights feature jollof rice, the iconic ndole accompanied by plantains and bobolo, and koki, a dish primarily enjoyed by the Barondo people. Finally, a preparation of snails served with rice offers another distinct taste of the region.
Demographics[edit]
The historical population data reveals a consistent upward trend from 1976 to 2015. Starting with 620,515 residents in 1976, the population grew to 838,042 by 1987, representing an annual growth rate of 2.77%. This growth continued, reaching 1,316,079 in 2005 with a slightly lower annual increase of 2.54%. By 2015, the population had further expanded to 1,553,320, though the annual growth rate had moderated to 1.67%.
